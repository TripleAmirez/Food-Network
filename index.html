                <p>Elise Bauer was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldn’t go away in 2001. In 2003, Elise moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years, recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents’ cooking on Simply Recipes. (Here’s more of that story.) Over the years, what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month! In 2020, Simply Recipes was acquired by Dotdash, a New York-based media company. <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/about-us-5096129" class="more">more...</a> </p>

                <h2><b>Chicken Ramen</b></h2>
                <p>In Japanese culture and cuisine, ramen has been elevated to a high art form—watch Tampopo if you haven’t seen the movie already. You will become a believer.</p>

                <p>This is a green salad unlike any you have ever tasted. The star of the show is kombu, a type of kelp often enjoyed in East Asia but easily found in the U.S.</p>
